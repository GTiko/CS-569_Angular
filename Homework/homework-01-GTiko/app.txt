# Singleton

    Restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. The Single ton pa t tern can be 
implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance o f the class i f 
one doesn't exist . I f an instance already existing , i t simply re turns a reference to tha t 
instance .
There must be exactly one instance o f a class , and i t mus t be accessible to clients f rom a 
common access point.

# Decorator pattern
    Decorators are functions that can modify or enhance the behavior of classes,
 methods, properties, or parameters. They are applied using the @decoratorName syntax above 
 the targeted element. Decorators are executed at runtime, allowing for dynamic customization. 
 Multiple decorators can be applied to the same element, executed in the order specified. 
 They can also be used on constructors, enabling modification during object creation
